# 🌿 AllerCheck

*A mobile app for detecting allergens and harmful ingredients in everyday products using the OpenFDA API.*

---

## 📖 Overview

**AllerCheck** helps users with **allergies and sensitivities** make safer product choices.
By scanning or searching for a product, the app identifies **potential allergens, irritants, and FDA recalls**, providing users instant, trustworthy health insights.

## 🎯 Motivation

Millions of consumers struggle to understand product ingredients or verify safety data. Manually checking labels or researching allergens is tedious and confusing.
**AllerCheck** bridges this gap by combining:

* The **OpenFDA API** for official product safety and recall data, and
* A **personal allergen profile** that flags risky ingredients.

This ensures every scan or search leads to safer, more informed choices.
